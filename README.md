This project shows how to implement a face detection algorithm through ReactJS and shows both frontend/backend code for connecting the ML Algo to assess any image with a face. It also shows how to draw squares around human faces with the built-in canvas feature. I used this project to enhance my comprehension of programming and it was based from a tutorial.
